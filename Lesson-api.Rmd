- Focus areas:
  - Security
  - Scalability
  - Fault Tolerance
  - Low Latency
- Every topic will be covered:
  - **Theory first**
  - **Practical implementation next**
  - **Real vulnerabilities and fixes**

---

### How This Course Is Structured

1. API Fundamentals  
2. Designing a Basic API  
3. Securing APIs  
4. Fault Tolerance & Resilience  
5. Performance & Low Latency  
6. Production Best Practices  

Each section:
- Concept explanation
- Architecture discussion
- Hands-on coding
- Common mistakes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Understand what an API really is.
- Explain why APIs exist and what problems they solve.
- Identify real-world use cases of APIs.
- Avoid common misconceptions about APIs.
- Build a strong mental model for future lessons.

## What Is an API?

### Simple Definition

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

An API is a way for **software systems to communicate with each other** in a structured and predictable way.

Think of it as a **contract** between two systems:
- One system provides data or functionality.
- Another system consumes it.

---

### Everyday Analogy

Imagine a restaurant:

- You (client) → place an order.
- Waiter (API) → takes your request.
- Kitchen (server/business logic) → prepares the food.
- Waiter → brings back the result.

You don’t go into the kitchen yourself.
You interact only through the waiter (API).

---

### Technical Definition

An API defines:

- What requests are allowed.
- What data format is expected.
- What responses will be returned.
- What errors may occur.

In web systems, APIs commonly use:
- HTTP
- JSON or XML
- Standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

---

### What an API Is NOT

- ❌ Not just a database.
- ❌ Not just a website.
- ❌ Not just a single endpoint.
- ❌ Not only backend code.

An API is a **communication layer and contract** between systems.

---

## Why Do APIs Exist?

### The Core Problem

Modern software is not a single application anymore.

We have:
- Mobile apps
- Web apps
- Microservices
- Third-party integrations
- Cloud services

All these systems must talk to each other reliably.

---

### Without APIs

Without APIs:

- Systems would be tightly coupled.
- Every change breaks multiple applications.
- No standard way to communicate.
- Hard to scale or secure.
- Integration becomes fragile and slow.

---

### With APIs

APIs provide:

- Clear communication contracts
- Loose coupling between systems
- Reusability of services
- Scalability
- Security boundaries
- Technology independence

---

### Real-World Examples

- A mobile app fetching user data from a backend.
- A payment service charging a credit card.
- A weather app pulling forecast data.
- A frontend dashboard displaying analytics from a backend service.

All these rely on APIs.

---

### Beginner Example

Example API call:

```{text}
GET /api/users/123
```

Response:

```{json}
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```


Your application doesn’t care how the data was fetched internally.
It only cares about the contract.

## Key Takeaways So Far

* An API enables communication between software systems.
* It defines rules, data formats, and behavior.
* APIs solve coupling, scalability, and integration problems.
* APIs act as a contract between producers and consumers.

* When to use each type
* Common misconceptions
