## Lesson Context

### Why Authorization Matters

Authentication verifies identity.  
Authorization controls permissions.

A secure system must ensure:
- Users can only access what they are allowed to.
- Privileged operations are protected.
- Data exposure is minimized.

Most real-world breaches are authorization failures.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson:

- Understand authorization concepts.
- Learn access control models.
- Identify common vulnerabilities.
- Design secure permission systems.
- Prepare for Spring Security implementation.

---

## What Is Authorization?

### Definition

Authorization determines what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform.

It answers:
> **"What can this user do?"**

### Authorization vs Authentication

- Authentication → Who you are
- Authorization → What you can access

Authorization always happens after authentication.

---

## Permissions & Roles

### Permissions

A permission represents an allowed action.

Examples:
- READ_USER
- CREATE_ORDER
- DELETE_PRODUCT

Permissions are fine-grained.

### Roles

A role groups permissions.

Examples:
- ADMIN
- USER
- SUPPORT

Roles simplify management.

---

## Role Example

ADMIN:
- CREATE_USER
- DELETE_USER
- VIEW_REPORTS

USER:
- VIEW_PROFILE
- CREATE_ORDER

---

## Access Control Models

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Users are assigned roles.
Roles grant permissions.

Simple and widely used.

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

Decisions based on attributes:
- User attributes
- Resource attributes
- Environment conditions

More flexible, more complex.

---

## Access Control Models

### Policy-Based Access Control

Centralized policies define access rules.

Used in large distributed systems.

---

## Where Authorization Happens

### API Layers

Authorization should occur:

- At controller level (endpoint protection)
- At service level (business rules)
- Sometimes at database level

Never trust client-side enforcement.

---

## Common Authorization Vulnerabilities

### Broken Access Control

Users access resources they should not.

Examples:
- Accessing another user's data
- Calling admin endpoints


### Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Manipulating IDs in URLs to access unauthorized data.

Example:
```

/users/123 → /users/124

```

---

## Common Authorization Vulnerabilities

### Over-Privileged Roles

Users receive more permissions than needed.

Violates least privilege principle.

---

## Authorization Best Practices

### Defense Strategies

- Enforce least privilege
- Validate ownership
- Use centralized policies
- Log authorization failures
- Perform regular audits

---

## Design for Scalability

### Future Growth

Authorization systems must:
- Support new roles
- Support new permissions
- Avoid hardcoded logic

Design early.

---

## What Comes Next

### Practical Implementation

- Implement role-based access in Spring Boot
- Protect endpoints
- Demonstrate IDOR attack
- Apply fixes
