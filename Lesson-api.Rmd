## Lesson Context

### Why API Design Comes First

- API design defines how clients interact with your system.
- Poor design causes:
  - Confusing usage
  - Security gaps
  - Breaking changes
  - Performance problems
- Good design enables:
  - Scalability
  - Maintainability
  - Evolvability

Design is an engineering decision, not aesthetics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson:

- Understand REST principles.
- Learn how to structure endpoints.
- Use HTTP methods correctly.
- Understand API versioning.
- Know how to pass data safely.
- Avoid common mistakes.

---

## What Is REST?

### REST Definition

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**.

It is an architectural style for designing networked applications.

### REST Principles (High Level)

- Stateless communication
- Resource-based URLs
- Standard HTTP methods
- Uniform interface
- Cacheability

REST improves scalability and simplicity.

---

## Designing Resources

### Think in Resources, Not Actions

Bad:
```json

/getUser
/createOrder
/deleteProduct

```

Good:
```json

/users
/orders
/products

```

Use nouns, not verbs.

---

## Resource Hierarchy

**Examples**:

```json

/users
/users/{id}
/users/{id}/orders

```

Relationships should be expressed naturally.

---

## HTTP Methods

### Common Methods

- **GET** → Retrieve data
- **POST** → Create new resource
- **PUT** → Replace resource
- **PATCH** → Partial update
- **DELETE** → Remove resource


### Idempotency

- GET → Idempotent
- PUT → Idempotent
- DELETE → Idempotent
- POST → Not idempotent

Important for retries and fault tolerance.

---

## Passing Data in APIs

### Path Parameters

Used to identify a specific resource.

**Example**:
```json

GET /users/123

```

Use when the value identifies the resource.


### Query Parameters

Used for filtering, sorting, pagination.

**Example**:
```json

GET /users?role=admin&page=2

```

Do not use for sensitive data.

---

## Passing Data in APIs

### Request Body

Used to send complex data.

Example:
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

Used mostly with POST, PUT, PATCH.

### Headers

Used for metadata:

* Authentication
* Content type
* Correlation IDs

---

## API Versioning

### Why Versioning Matters

* APIs evolve over time.
* Clients depend on existing behavior.
* Breaking changes must be managed safely.

---

## Versioning Strategies

- **URI Versioning**

```json
/api/v1/users
```

- **Header Versioning**

```json
Accept: application/vnd.company.v1+json
```

- **Query Versioning**

```json
/users?version=1
```

URI versioning is most common.

---

## Versioning Best Practices

* Only version breaking changes.
* Avoid unnecessary versions.
* Deprecate old versions gracefully.
* Communicate clearly.

---

## Status Codes & Errors

### Use HTTP Status Codes Correctly

* 200 → OK
* 201 → Created
* 400 → Bad Request
* 401 → Unauthorized
* 403 → Forbidden
* 404 → Not Found
* 500 → Server Error

### Error Response Design

Return structured errors:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid request",
  "message": "Email is required"
}
```

Avoid leaking internal details.

---

## Pagination & Filtering

### Avoid Large Responses

Use pagination:

```json
GET /users?page=1&size=20
```

### Filtering & Sorting

```json
GET /orders?status=PAID&sort=date
```

---

## Common Design Mistakes

* Using verbs in URLs
* Ignoring HTTP status codes
* Overloading endpoints
* Breaking clients unintentionally
* Mixing responsibilities
* Inconsistent naming

---

## Design Enables Security & Performance

### Why This Matters Later

Good design:

* Simplifies authentication
* Enables caching
* Improves monitoring
* Reduces attack surface
* Enables scalability

---

## What Comes Next

### Next Lesson

* Build a basic Spring Boot API
* Apply these design principles
* Create clean endpoints
* Prepare for security hardening
