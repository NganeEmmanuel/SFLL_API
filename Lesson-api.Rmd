## Lesson Context

### Where We Are

- ✅ Built a basic API
- ✅ Learned injection attacks
- ✅ Secured object binding with DTOs
- 🚨 Now we control identity and access

Authentication answers the question:
> Who is making this request?

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson:

- Understand authentication concepts.
- Differentiate authentication vs authorization.
- Learn common authentication approaches.
- Understand password security basics.
- Learn token-based authentication concepts.
- Understand tradeoffs and risks.

---

## Authentication vs Authorization

### Authentication

Authentication answers:
> Who are you?

**Examples**:
- Username + password
- Token
- Certificate
- Biometric

### Authorization

Authorization answers:
> What are you allowed to do?

**Examples**:
- Roles
- Permissions
- Policies

---

## Common Confusion

Authentication and authorization solve different problems.

- Authentication answers: **Who are you?**
- Authorization answers: **What are you allowed to do?**

You must authenticate first before authorization can be evaluated.

**Example**:
- User logs in → identity is verified (authentication)
- System checks role → access is granted or denied (authorization)

Mixing these concepts leads to insecure designs.
---

## Why APIs Need Authentication

### What Happens Without Authentication

- Anyone can call endpoints.
- Data exposure.
- Abuse and automation.
- No accountability.
- No audit trail.

Public APIs still require identity tracking.

---

## Trust Boundaries

Authentication establishes:

- Identity
- Trust level
- Accountability
- Traceability

---

## Common Authentication Models

### Basic Authentication

- Username and password sent with every request.
- Simple but insecure unless HTTPS is enforced.

**Limitations**:
- Credentials exposed frequently.
- Hard to revoke.
- Poor scalability.

---

## Common Authentication Models

### Session-Based Authentication

- Server stores session state.
- Client stores session ID (cookie).
- Common in traditional web apps.

**Limitations**:
- Harder to scale horizontally.
- Requires sticky sessions or shared cache.

---

## Common Authentication Models

### Token-Based Authentication

- Server issues a token after login.
- Client sends token on each request.
- Server validates token.

**Common types**:
- JWT
- OAuth access tokens

**Benefits**:
- Stateless
- Scalable
- Cloud friendly

---

## Common Authentication Models

### API Keys

- Static keys per client.
- Used mostly for service-to-service or public APIs.

**Limitations**:
- Weak identity
- Hard rotation
- Often leaked

---

## Password Security Basics

### Never Store Plaintext Passwords

Passwords must always be:

- **Hashed**: Converted into a one-way mathematical value that cannot be reversed.
- **Salted**: Random data added before hashing to prevent duplicate and precomputed attacks.
- **Stored securely**: Saved with restricted access and encryption, never as raw passwords.

Never reversible.

---

## Hashing vs Encryption

- Hashing → One-way
- Encryption → Two-way

Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted.

---

## Common Hash Algorithms

**Secure**:
- bcrypt
- Argon2
- scrypt

**Avoid**:
- MD5
- SHA1

---

## Password Attacks

Attackers attempt:

- **Brute force**: Trying many password combinations until the correct one is found.
- **Credential stuffing**: Using leaked username-password pairs from other sites.
- **Rainbow tables**: Using precomputed hash databases to reverse weak hashes.
- **Phishing**: Tricking users into revealing their credentials through fake interfaces.

Defense requires layered protection.


---

## Token Fundamentals

### What Is a Token?

A token is a digital proof of authentication.

It represents:

- User identity
- Claims
- Expiration
- Integrity

### JWT Structure (Conceptual)

- Header
- Payload (claims)
- Signature

JWT is signed, not encrypted by default.

---

## Token Lifecycle

1. User logs in.
2. Server validates credentials.
3. Token is issued.
4. Client stores token.
5. Token sent with each request.
6. Token expires or revoked.

---

## Security Risks

### Token Risks

- **Token theft**: An attacker steals a valid token and uses it to impersonate a user.
- **Token replay**: A captured token is reused to repeat authorized requests.
- **Token leakage**: Tokens are accidentally exposed through logs, URLs, or client storage.
- **Long expiration windows**: Stolen tokens remain valid for too long, increasing damage.

---

## Security Risks

### Defending Against Token Risks

- **Short token expiration**: Limits the damage window if a token is stolen.
- **HTTPS everywhere**: Prevents interception and token theft in transit.
- **Secure storage**: Never store tokens in URLs or insecure client storage.
- **Token rotation & refresh**: Reduces reuse and replay risk.
- **Audience and scope validation**: Ensures tokens are used only for intended services.
- **Revocation and monitoring**: Detects and blocks suspicious token usage quickly.

---

## Security Risks

### Password Risks

- Weak passwords
- Reuse across sites
- Phishing
- Database breaches

### Transport Risks

- Unencrypted traffic
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

---

## Security vs Performance

### Cost of Authentication

- Password hashing CPU cost
- Token validation overhead
- Cryptographic operations

### Why It's Worth It

- Identity protection
- Legal compliance
- User trust
- System integrity

---

## What We Will Do Practically

### Next Video Plan

1. Implement login endpoint.
2. Store hashed passwords.
3. Generate authentication token.
4. Secure endpoints.
5. Validate token on requests.
6. Measure overhead.

## Key Takeaways

- Authentication verifies identity.
- Authorization controls access.
- Tokens enable scalable APIs.
- Passwords must be hashed securely.
- Security requires layered defenses.
