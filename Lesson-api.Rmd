## Lesson Context

### Where We Are in the Series

- ✅ What is an API
- ✅ API architecture
- ✅ Built a basic Spring Boot API
- 🚨 Now we secure it

We intentionally start with a simple, insecure system.

---

## Why This Matters

Most security breaches:
- Are not advanced hacks
- Are basic mistakes
- Are preventable
- Come from poor design decisions

Security is not a feature.
It is a **system property**.

---

## What Is API Security?

### Definition

API Security is the practice of protecting:

- Data
- Users
- Infrastructure
- Business logic
- Availability

from unauthorized access, abuse, or manipulation.

---

## What We Are Protecting

- 🔒 User data (PII - personal identifiable information, credentials)
- 💳 Financial transactions
- 🧠 Business logic
- 🖥 Infrastructure resources
- 📈 System availability

APIs are high-value targets.

---

## Why APIs Are Attacked More Than UIs

- Direct access to business logic
- No visual barriers
- Automation friendly
- Often poorly monitored
- Exposed to the internet

Attackers love APIs.

---

## Threat Mindset

### Think Like an Attacker

Attackers ask:

- What inputs can I control?
- What assumptions exist?
- What data can I manipulate?
- What happens if I send invalid data?
- What if I bypass validation?

Security begins with curiosity.

---

## Attack Surface

Attack surface includes:

- Endpoints
- Request parameters
- Headers
- Payloads
- Authentication mechanisms
- Dependencies
- Configuration

Every input is a potential attack vector.

---

## Why Security Is Hard

### Complexity

Modern systems have:

- Multiple services
- Third-party integrations
- Distributed infrastructure
- Rapid deployment cycles

Complexity increases risk.

---

## Why Security Is Hard

### Human Error

- Misconfiguration
- Weak validation
- Hardcoded secrets
- Copy-paste code
- Incomplete testing

Most breaches are accidental.

---

## Security vs Performance Tradeoff

### Security Has a Cost

Security adds:

- Encryption overhead
- Validation processing
- Authentication latency
- Logging overhead
- Network hops

---

## Security vs Performance Tradeoff

### The Goal Is Balance

We aim for:

- ✔️ Strong enough security
- ✔️ Acceptable latency
- ✔️ Good user experience
- ✔️ Operational simplicity

Not maximum security at all costs.

---

## Security vs Performance Tradeoff

### Engineering Is Tradeoffs

Security decisions impact:

- Latency
- Throughput
- Complexity
- Cost
- Developer velocity

We must measure and justify.

---

## Real-World Consequences

### What Happens When APIs Are Insecure?

- Data breaches
- Financial loss
- Legal penalties
- Brand damage
- Loss of trust

Small bugs → massive damage.

---

## Example: Injection Attacks

If user input is not validated:

- Attackers inject commands
- Bypass authentication
- Read or modify data
- Destroy databases

We will demonstrate this practically.

---

## Our Security Learning Strategy

### How This Series Will Teach Security

For each topic:

1. Understand the concept
2. Observe a real vulnerability
3. Perform a controlled attack
4. Implement protection
5. Re-test the attack
6. Measure impact

---

### Topics We Will Cover

- Input validation & injection
- DTOs & mass assignment
- Authentication
- Authorization
- HTTPS & TLS
- Rate limiting
- Secrets management
- Logging & auditing
